Adapted from: https://github.com/Sean-Bradley/Three.js-TypeScript-Boilerplate

Artists, use baconRand.rand() in place of Math.random() in your sketches.

THREE.js and P5js are available dependecies.

Drop your sketch module in /src as index.js.

Type npm start in terminal.

Recover your bundle at /dist/main.js.

View it on localhost:8081. Each refresh should produce new deterministic randomness wherever baconRand.rand() was used.
